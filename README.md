## Features and Benefits

### Skeleton loading indicator

The [Data Grid](https://www.syncfusion.com/vue-components/vue-grid) shows the Shimmer effect as a loading indicator while fetching data and binding it to the grid during initial rendering, refreshing, or after performing grid actions like sorting, filtering, grouping, and more. The Data Grid offers two types of loading indicator effect, spinner and shimmer.

### Column

Columns define the schema of data source in the Data Grid. It supports formatting, auto generating columns, column definitions, freezing rows and columns, column spanning, text wrapping, column chooser, column menu, and other features.

### Paging

Paging is used to view a segment of data from the assigned data source. The Vue Data Grid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI. It also has an on-demand paging mode for effective data retrieval from remote web services.

### Filtering

Filtering helps view particular or related records in the Data Grid, which meet a given criteria. Data grid supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter. Choose appropriate filter type, define your own custom filtering logic, and customize the filtering UI based on the application needs. Diacritic characters can also be filtered.
